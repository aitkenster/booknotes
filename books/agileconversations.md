How to analyse your own conversations

4 Rs
- Record
  - Think of a difficult conversation you wish had gone better
  - Take a piece of paper, fold into 2 columns
    - Right column: The spoken conversation
    - Left column: your unspoken thoughts
- Reflect
  - on transparency
    - how many questions did you ask?
    - how many of those questions were genuine?
      - you really want to know the answer
      - the answer might surprise you
      - you would be willing to change your views
    - what unexpressed thoughts and feelings were in the left column?
  - on patterns
    - Triggers: caused you to react strongly
    - Tells: behaviour signalling you aren't acting with transparency / curiousity
    - Twitches: instinctive default response
- Revise
  - Rewrite the conversation to address the issues you idenitifed
- Role play
  - Say the revised dialogue out loud
